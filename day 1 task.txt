 * HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications.

 * HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.HTTP2 is much faster
   and more efficient than HTTP1.1

 * HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all 
   the other resources behind it. But for HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple
   streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.      

 * HTTP1.1 used to process text commands to complete the request response cycles. But HTTP2 uses binary 
   commands for the same task. So the browser that uses HTTP2 will first convert the text commands into 
   binary and then transmits over the network.

 * Small files load more quickly than large ones. To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
   compress HTTP messages to make them smaller. However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method 
   called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.
